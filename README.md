All files have the same content, just in different formats, choose the one you prefer, I recommend PDF to avoid incompatibility issues.

## Notes
- The style:
It did not translate the document with Ms Word so empty spaces may need to be accommodated, the table of contents for example, or the links.
- The repetition of words:
I think many words like "aprendices", "mentoria", etc. are repeated a lot. Although this also occurs in the English version, but I'm probably overthinking this.
